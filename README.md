# ValTracker

#### Passion Project: ValTracker
#### ValTracker is a web application that lets user type their gamerID and #tag and displays their Valorant account statistics. This website is used amongst a group of Valorant players who want to proudly display there player rank and stats. Users can also compare their performance rate to other selected Valorant players and receive a ranking system within the group. Once user inputs their gamerID and tag it will display their gamerID/tag, user rank image, number of kills, kill/death ratio,  games won, win percentage rate,  total games played, *best Agent and most recently played game with stats.

#### This app can potentially display the last 10 competitive matches, last 5 matches, *match statistics for a specific match, leaderboard data in NA region, available store offers, in game shop offers, in game content.

#### Ill complete this project using Spring, JAVA, RESTful API, MySQL DB, and React front end app. Henrick-3 unofficial valorant API will be used to pull data from the official Riot API database in JSON format. This will be parsed and stored as Strings in MySQL database to be used in the front end.

#### This project has the potential to scale up and take more users once official Valorant API is approved.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96934316/184690429-28d069ab-b6fa-4b43-ab74-a4cacb0510fd.png)
